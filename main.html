    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is the technique used to evalute the efficiency of an Program in terms of time to execute
        The time complexity is a mathematical way of evaluating the change in time to execute the program based on the
        input size of the Program

        Its is measured in big O, big theta and big oremga notations
        big O is worst time complexity
        big theta is average time complexity
        big omega is best time complexity

        examples are : O(1) < O(log(n)) < O(n) < O(n^2) < O(n^3) < O(2^n) Lower the big O function the program will be
            more efficient</p>


            <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the technique used to evalute the efficiency of an Program in terms of memory
                The space complexity is a mathematical way of evaluating the change in extra space used to execute the
                program based on the
                input size of the Program

                Its is measured in big O, big theta and big oremga notations
                big O is worst space complexity
                big theta is average space complexity
                big omega is best space complexity

                examples are : O(1) < O(log(n)) < O(n) < O(n^2) < O(n^3) < O(2^n) Lower the big O function the program
                    will be more efficient.</p>
